- Expand object type coercion.
- What about Java enums and their values?

Upcoming features:
    - Fragment functions
    - new Object ()
    - Static function calls
    - Also check out the roadmap in the Wiki.

Ideas:
    - @Template (post post, integer integer) etc. named arguments are redundant and annoying. Find a way to
      find out the name of the parameter so the user does not have to specify it.
    - Replace System.out.println with a Logger?
    - Support <!DOCTYPE x> with a function (and possibly an enum).
    - Allow closures to receive a closure input parameter. This requires that the parameter name for the closure
      can be specified when calling the closure.

Absolutely needed improvements:
    - Better ANTLR and AST error reporting (with an error list, instead of aborting the compilation instantly).

Tests:
    - Test the tab to indentation translation of the lexer.
    - Make benchmark test functions optional.
    - Write Boolean test (With boxing/unboxing).

API:
    - Make the API easier to use.

Build:
    - Create a script that generates the ANTLR4 sources
    - Get the ANTLR 4.4.1 jar from maven
