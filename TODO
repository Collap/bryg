- Mention in the language reference that === is reference equality, while == is value equality.
    Reference equality includes the condition that the references are equal, while value equality
    only makes sure that the values are equal or that a specific equals implementation returns true.
    Since values at the same reference must fulfill the equals condition, reference equality always
    includes value equality.

Upcoming features:
    - Parameter predicates: option(selected if false)
    - Variable mutability
    - Fragment functions
    - new Object ()
    - Check if there needs to be more boxing.

Ideas:
    - @Template (post post, integer integer) etc. named arguments are redundant and annoying. Find a way to
      find out the name of the parameter so the user does not have to specify it.
    - @.Template (...) to invoke a template in the current "package" (relative template path).
      Also: @.sub.Template (...) for a subpackage.
