- More boxing and unboxing in method and function calls.
- Add coercion to method and function calls.
- Expand object type coercion.
- Make benchmark test functions optional.
- Possibly remove the unary + operator, which does essentially nothing.
- What about Java enums and their values?

Upcoming features:
    - Parameter predicates: option(selected if false)
    - @.Template (...) to invoke a template in the current "package" (relative template path).
      Also: @.sub.Template (...) for a subpackage.
    - Fragment functions
    - new Object ()
    - Static function calls

Ideas:
    - @Template (post post, integer integer) etc. named arguments are redundant and annoying. Find a way to
      find out the name of the parameter so the user does not have to specify it.
    - Replace System.out.println with a Logger?

Absolutely needed improvements:
    - Better ANTLR and AST error reporting (with an error list, instead of aborting the compilation instantly).
